# Cats

Cats, in my opinion, are kind of assholes. Unlike dogs, they often seem indifferent and can act like they own the place. Sure, some people find their aloof and independent nature charming, but I've never been a fan. They knock things off shelves, ignore you until they want food, and generally strut around like they're better than everyone else.

Maybe that's just the way they are, but I definitely don't like them. Give me a friendly, excited dog any day.

## Typical Cat Behaviors

- **Knocking things over:** Many cats love to push objects off tables or shelves, just to watch them fall.
- **Ignoring commands:** Cats rarely listen when you call them or ask them to do something, and they come and go as they please.
- **Demanding attention (on their schedule):** Strangely, when they're hungry or want attention, they suddenly become affectionate—but only until they've gotten what they want.

## Why Some People Like Cats (even if I don't)

Some people appreciate cats for their low-maintenance attitude and the fact that they don't need as much attention as other pets. They can be independent and are generally easy to care for. Still, none of that changes the fact that I don't like them personally, mostly because of their attitude and tendency to act like jerks.

## Fun Fact

Despite their behavior, cats are one of the most popular pets in the world. Maybe people are into that whole "unattainable" vibe—but it's definitely not for me!
